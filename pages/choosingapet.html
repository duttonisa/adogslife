	<h2>How to chose the right pet for you:</h2>
	<dl>
	<dt>Before you begin,</dt><dd> you have to understand owning another life isn't just for fun. It is an investment and a long term commitment.</dd>
	<dt>Then, ask yourself,</dt><dd> are you responsible enough to own and take care of another life, and wont neglect them.</dd>
	<dt>Consider your living conditions </dt>
	<dd>EG. is it suitable for me to own a big dog, if I live in a small apartment?</dd>
	<dt>Research</dt>
	<dd>Before you just go out and pick someone up, take the time to find what would be most suitable for you.</dd>
	<dt>Love</dt>
	<dd>Once you've decided you're ready to move forward, once you go out the explore, the right pet will chose you. Be patient and wait until you get a good feeling. No need to rush things.<dd>
